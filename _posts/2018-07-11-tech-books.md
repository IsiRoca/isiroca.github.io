# Technical Books

>Alice: Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?. 
 The Cheshire Cat: That depends a good deal on where you want to get to. 
 Alice: I don't much care where. 
 The Cheshire Cat: Then it doesn't much matter which way you go. 
 Alice: ...So long as I get somewhere. 
 The Cheshire Cat: Oh, you're sure to do that, if only you walk long enough. 
 (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland - Lewis Carroll)

A books library for programmers.

The goal of this library is to make you a more proficient developer. 
You'll find books that have become timeless classics or I've found truly inspiring.

This page is not meant to be comprehensive. The selection of books is opinionated.

Contributing to this book library. Feel free to open a PR to contribute! Thanks.
